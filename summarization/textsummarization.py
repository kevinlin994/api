test = "There is a total of 161 partners in the $1M+ TTM Tranche, which is up from 125 (vs. last year) and 161 (vs. last month) representing 29% YoY growth. This is down from February number of 166. 63 of these partners are coming from the $100K-999K & <$100K tranches. The growth in the $100-999K tranche when it comes to number of partners is 13%, which is mainly driven by CSP (45 growth). With continued efforts to build the Power Apps ecosystem, 56+ AIAD were delivered and Airlifts via Teams since late March. The NEW Partner Playbook and Pitch deck are launching during June. For Power Bi, since March this year, 76 Partners executed a total of Virtual DIAD 162 sessions with ~4,000 attendees, resulting in 1,000+ leads. 150+ more DIAD planned by end of FY20. The first VILT of the Power BI Adoption Framework was finished with 1,945 partner attendees. When it comes to BGI, the targeted partner investments, there have been 10 partners in the top performance category grow 78% YoY and 15 partners in the next tranche category grow 215% YoY as a group. While this represents 50 of the SIs invested in, the year 1 of BGI gives great learnings to apply in FY21 to target investments towards new areas of growth around the new 6 Sales Plays. From the ISV Investments, there have been 23 Business Central applications migrated that are published in AppSource. Lastly, while we learned a lot about our GSI investments and are redesigning how to measure impact, weâ€™re seeing 50%+ YoY in the Business Apps influenced revenue coming from Accenture and KPMG."
